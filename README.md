# EcoDataHub
EcoDataHub is a unified platform for collecting, comparing, and visualizing environmental indicators from North Macedonia and the European Union.
The system aggregates data from multiple official sources — including MAKStat API, Eurostat, and other environmental datasets — and transforms them into clear, interactive visual insights.

Its main purpose is to help the general public understand how North Macedonia compares to European trends in key ecological areas such as:

  - CO₂ emissions
  
  - Air quality
  
  - Water use by sectors
  
  - Waste generation
  
  - Environmental sustainability indicators
  
  - Long-term changes and regional trends
